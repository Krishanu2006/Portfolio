            Hi, I'm Krishanu Das!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am a passionate and driven B.Tech student entering my second year, with a strong foundation in full-stack web development and programming. I have hands-on experience in building responsive and dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS on the frontend, along with FastAPI and Python for backend development. Additionally, I am proficient in Java and C, which has strengthened my problem-solving skills and understanding of core programming concepts.
            I enjoy exploring real-world applications of technology, collaborating on innovative projects, and continuously upgrading my skills. I am currently looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in practical settings and contribute meaningfully to team-based environments.
